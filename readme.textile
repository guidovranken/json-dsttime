h1. JSON DST Time

Google App Engine project returns the UTC and localized datetime object as JSON for a given datetime and timezone. The response includes whether the timezone was observing daylight savings on the date queried.

h2. Arguments

*tz* the Orson recognised timezone. e.g. EDT or Europe/London. Case is important!
*dt* the datestring to be processed

h2. Examples

# query @http://json-dsttime.appspot.com@ to get the current datetime in utc
# query @http://json-dsttime.appspot.com?tz=Europe/London@ to get the current datetime in the Europe/London timezone
# query @http://json-dsttime.appspot.com?tz=Europe/London&dt=2009-09-21T10:00@ to get the localized datetime for Europe/London at 10am on 21 September 2009

h2. General Notes

This is alpha 1 thrown together in a couple of hours to learn how App Engine works. There's probably a couple of things which could go wrong that I haven't trapped for yet. If you find any add them to the issues page and i'll fix them up.
